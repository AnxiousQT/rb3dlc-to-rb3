This is the repo for Rock Band 3 DLC converted over to Rock Band 2.
Note that some of these CONs will be updated over time.
It's highly recommended to put the DLCs into packs before installing, if installing in bulk.
When adding your chosen songs to a pack, it is also highly recommended to put the following script in the pack's song.dta so you don't get any duplicate entries in Rock Band 3.
